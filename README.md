# TroperShield
Gets rid of the ability to interact with TvTropes in any way other than reading the pages.
## Purpose
TvTropes is like a time bomb. It's better to just watch from a safe distance if you don't want to miss it. That's what TroperShield is designed for. It disables the login, social features, and editing, of TvTropes so you can sit and read the pages from a safe distance.
## How to Use
Install Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey and import the userscript into the extension. It should start working immediately.
